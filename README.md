# 🌍 Life Expectancy Prediction – Health Meets Machine Learning 🧬

Hi there! 👋 I’m **Madhumitha Murugaiyan**, a biochemistry graduate with a growing passion for Data Analytics and AI.

This project uses real-world **World Health Organization (WHO)** data to explore how factors like **GDP**, **education**, **alcohol consumption**, and **healthcare access** affect how long people live across countries.

---

## 🔍 What’s Inside?
- 📊 Data cleaning and preprocessing using Python
- 📈 Visualization of GDP, Schooling, Alcohol vs Life Expectancy
- 🔥 Correlation heatmap of all health/economic variables
- 🤖 Machine Learning Models (Random Forest + XGBoost)
- 🎯 Model comparison using R² and RMSE
- 💡 SHAP plots for explainability
- 💾 Saved model for deployment

---

## 💻 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP
- Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)

---

## 🧠 Key Findings
- **Schooling** and **GDP** are strong positive indicators of life expectancy
- **Alcohol consumption** shows a weaker, complex relationship
- XGBoost performed best with an R² of ~0.85 on test data

---

## 📁 Files Included
- `life_expectancy.ipynb`: Full code notebook (Colab)
- `life_expectancy_full_sample.csv`: The dataset (upload if not done)
- `life_expectancy_xgb_model.pkl`: Trained model file (optional)
