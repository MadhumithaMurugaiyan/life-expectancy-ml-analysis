# 🌍 Life Expectancy Prediction – Health Meets Machine Learning 🧬

Hi there! 👋 I’m **Madhumitha Murugaiyan**, a Biochemistry graduate with a growing passion for **Data Analytics** and **AI**.

This project explores real-world **World Health Organization (WHO)** data to understand how factors like **GDP**, **education**, **alcohol consumption**, and **healthcare access** influence how long people live across countries.

---

## 🔍 What’s Inside
- 📊 Data cleaning and preprocessing using Python
- 📈 Visualizations of GDP, Schooling, Alcohol vs Life Expectancy
- 🔥 Correlation heatmap of health & economic variables
- 🤖 Machine Learning: Random Forest + XGBoost
- 🎯 Model comparison using R² and RMSE
- 💡 SHAP plots for feature explainability
- 💾 Model saved for reuse (deployment-ready)

---

## 💻 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP
- Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)

---

## 🧠 Key Findings
- 📚 **Schooling** and 💰 **GDP** are strong predictors of higher life expectancy
- 🥂 **Alcohol consumption** has a more complex, weaker relationship
- 🚀 **XGBoost** outperformed other models with an R² ~0.85

---

## 📁 Files Included
- `life_expectancy.ipynb` – Full notebook (Google Colab)
- `life_expectancy_full_sample.csv` – The dataset
- `life_expectancy_xgb_model.pkl` – Trained XGBoost model (optional)
